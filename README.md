#### Project Title

   Unity in Motion (subject to change)

---
#### Motivation

  Our group wanted to create a game in Unity, due to the accessibility of tools and our interest in video games. We all have no experience using Unity or C#, so this will provide all of us with an opportunity to learn and develop a working game. It also requires delegation and sound software engineering practices over the semester.

#### Brief overview of the proposal

  We are making a 2D, survival sidescroller game featuring randomly generated enemies and randomly generated environment elements. As the player remains alive, they will have to strategize against progressively more difficult enemies. The game will feature a scoring system to incentivize the player to get a higher score. For greater replayability, the game will also feature unlockable items purchased with the “points” earned at the end of each playthrough.

---
#### Features to be Implemented

- The game must be implemented with C# and Unity
- The game will be operated through the mouse and keyboard
- The game will feature music and sound effects
- Highscore system that will save the users records
- Appropriate hitboxes and collision between enemies, player, and the environment.

#### Risks & Challenges

- Time constraints 
- Lack of experience with creating games
- Wanting to implement too many features
